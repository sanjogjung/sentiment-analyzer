review,sentiment
"I found this move beautiful, enjoyable, and uplifting.  ",1
"It's as continuously beautiful to look at as a Bertolucci, but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that master's work.  ",1
The story is beyond stupid.  ,0
"I think the most wonderful parts (literally, full of ""wonder"") are the excerpts from his works.  ",1
"Unfortunately, inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict.  ",0
This is high adventure at its best.  ,1
"Yeah, the movie pretty much sucked.  ",0
"There was NO chemistry between Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock in this film, and I couldn't understand why he would consider even leaving his wife-to-be for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by.  ",0
This scene is very strong and unpleasant.  ,0
But this understated film leaves a lasting impression.  ,1
It came free with a DVD player I bought but I still turned the thing off halfway through because I was embarrassed for Howell.  ,0
"This movie creates its own universe, and is fascinating in every way.  ",1
Meredith M was better than all right.  ,1
Go watch it!  ,1
All the characters in this film are tremendously well played.  ,1
Never heard of any of them except Cole who was totally unbelievable in the part.  ,0
I love the Scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there.  ,1
So bad...well...it's just bad.  ,0
If you haven't choked in your own vomit by the end (by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue) you've must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time.  ,0
"A very good film indeed, about great and unconditional love.  ",1
Avoid at all costs.  ,0
This is a stunning movie.  ,1
"In conclusion, I will not bother with this movie because a volcano in Los Angeles is nothing but nonsense.  ",0
I thought it was bad.  ,0
The stories were as unbelievable as the actors.  ,0
"She is as lovely as usual, this cutie!  ",1
"If this premise sound stupid, that's because it is.  ",0
I liked the way Dustin Hoffman's character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son.  ,1
"But if you liked movies like The Matrix (and better yet, their sequels) I think you'll appreciate the thought provoking, mindblowing experience this film will give you.  ",1
"But the convoluted plot just didn't convince me, and much of the film was watched with a weird, questioning glance.  ",0
"The acting is fantastic, the stories are seamlessly woven together, and the dogs are splendid............. A must rent, view, or see.  ",1
"Their on-screen chemistry, critical to the entire film, is genuine.  ",1
" With great sound effects, and impressive special effects, I can't recommend this movie enough.  	1
Call me a nut, but I think this is one of the best movies ever.  	1
Great character actors Telly Savalas and Peter Boyle.  	1
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium, melodrama and horrible acting, a mess of a script, and a sinking feeling of GOOD LORD, WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?  	0
Lots of holes in the script.  	0
It's like a bad two hour TV movie.  	0
Now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong.  	0
The dialogue is atrocious.  	0
The acting is beyond abysmal.  	0
Everything stinks.  	0
Trouble is, the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable, like character, story, theme and so on.  	0
Worse, there's an incredibly weak sub-plot thrown in that follows a little band of latter-day Mansonites as they go after a reporter who's working on a story on the anniversary of the killings.  	0
It's dumb and pointless, and a complete waste of time.  	0
In short, don't bother with this movie.  	0
I won't spoil it, but the ending in pretty amazing.  	1
The best scene in the movie is at the end, but I won't spoil it.  	1
If there was ever an indication of a writer and a director's ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity, then this is it!  	1
The result is a powerhouse achievement, made more timely now perhaps because of our culture's disturbing fascination with celebrity, and it's distorted interpretations of fame.  	1
A film not easily forgotten.  	1
But, Kevin Spacey is an excellent, verbal tsunami as Buddy Ackerman Â– and totally believable because he is a great actor.  	1
The scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years.  	1
The characters are interesting, even if a bit predictable.  	1
Highly recommended for all ages, although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references, they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular!  	1
Great movie!  	1
Also the story and acting were weak.  	0
At around 4 pm I bought it, at around 8pm I started to watch, at around 8.15pm I fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain... but there wasn't.  	0
Either way, it sucks.  	0
The script is horrendously stupid.  	0
The story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or build-up in the slightest.  	0
Everything Captain Howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid.  	0
What the hell kind of crap is that?!  	0
Then, there's the plot holes.  	0
You could drive a semi truck into these holes!  	0
Linda Cardellini is the only thing good in this film.  	1
She's poised and amazing.  	1
Dee Snider just plain sucks.  	0
He can't act (one of the least scary villains I have ever seen), he can't write (did he write this damn movie in his sleep?  	0
I was bored throughout the whole damn thing.  	0
The acting sucks, the music sucks, the script sucks, the pacing sucks, the special FX suck, the directing sucks... basically, this movie sucks.  	0
This film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thriller/horror flick and it fails miserably.  	0
This is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films I have ever seen in my entire life.  	0
A piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid.  	0
Avoid at any and all costs.  	0
At any rate this film stinks, its not funny, and Fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies.  	0
Avoid this film at all costs.  	0
I don't know what happened in Season Five, what a mess.  	0
The only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of Leni Parker and Anita LaSelva as the two Taelons in quiet idealogical conflict.  	0
Now this is a movie I really dislike.  	0
It's one of the most boring Horror movies from the 90's mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere.  	0
The puppets look really cheesy , not in a good way like in the Puppet Master 80's flicks.  	0
The story is lame, not interesting and NEVER really explains the sinister origins of the puppets.  	0
There aren't death scenes like in previous movies and the f/x are terrible.  	0
I felt asleep the first time I watched it, so I can recommend it for insomniacs.  	0
The fact is, this film is a wonderful, heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams.  	1
The best part about Nurse Betty"" is it's unpredictability.  ",1
I must say I have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again.  ,1
In short - this was a monumental waste of time and energy and I would not recommend anyone to EVER see this film.  ,0
Really awful.  ,0
It rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets.  ,1
"Each track commands sentiment, actually contributing to the scenes and characters.  ",1
Nine out of ten for a truly lovely film.  ,1
"I love Lane, but I've never seen her in a movie this lousy.  ",0
"Still, it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost.  ",1
You will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars.  ,1
"Emily Watson's character is very strong, and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything.  ",1
"About 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudo-Satanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen Goth blush, almost always in Olde English, and sometimes in Latin that may or may not be made up words.  ",0
"The film's dialogue is natural, real to life.  ",1
It was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part.  ,1
The movie is full of wonderful dancing (hence the title!  ,1
10/10  ,1
The stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art.  ,1
"I don't understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store, it's not even a real movie!  ",0
This film (and I use that word loosely) is an insult to the movie-going public.  ,0
Now you know why I gave it a 10+!  ,1
The things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch.  ,1
About ten minutes into this film I started having second thoughts.  ,0
"This film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process, that it's not about discovering guilt or innocence, but rather, is about who presents better in court.  ",1
"Aside from it's terrible lead, this film has loads of other debits.  ",0
Nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great master's stable.  ,1
"The movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the ""acting coach"" are fascinating.  ",1
It is zillion times away from reality.  ,0
"So for our enjoyment we get to see them run around, play games, and be dangerous.  ",1
"I really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies, and that they will continue to do so in their own, some kinda weird style.  ",1
This is just a great movie.  ,1
"The acting was bad, the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere.  ",0
It was a riot to see Hugo Weaving play a sex-obsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients' houses for his trysts with the flaming Darren (Tom Hollander).  ,1
This was one of the worst films i have ever seen.  ,0
"It had some average acting from the main person, and it was a low budget as you clearly can see.  ",0
"Some applause should be given to the ""prelude"" however.  ",1
"An Italian reviewer called this ""a small, great film,"" and that's right.  ",1
"Let's start with all the problemsÂ—the acting, especially from the lead professor, was very, very bad.  ",0
The Wind and the Lion is well written and superbly acted.  ,1
"Lifetime does not air it enough, so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a must-have.  ",1
Excellently produced by one of Sci-fi's best producers Scot Vandiver !  ,1
1/10 - and only because there is no setting for 0/10.  ,0
The directing is sloppy at best.  ,0
"first of all, there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone.  ",0
"I wish I could enter negative values, admins?  ",0
It presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives.  ,1

Almost all of the songs in Cover Girl are old-fashioned and not very tuneful.  ,0
The lighting is awful.  ,0
10 out of 10 stars.  ,1
"Totally different, with loads of understatement and black comedy, this is a film few get to see, but those who do will remember it.  ",1
It's a feel-good film and that's how I felt when I came out of the cinema!  ,1
No plot whatsoever!  ,0
The cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip.  ,1
"Hayao Miyazaki's latest and eighth film for Studio Ghibili, ""Gake No Ue No Ponyo"" (Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea) is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood.  ",1
Everything from acting to cinematography was solid.  ,1
"The acting, as you'd expect from this cast, is top notch.  ",1
Lame would be the best way to describe it.  ,0
But other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didn't really work for their freedom.  ,0
"Oh yeah, and the storyline was pathetic too.  ",0
"Though The Wind and the Lion is told largely through the eyes of the son, every member of the family can identify with one of the characters, whether it be Sean Connery's noble brigand, Candace Bergen's feisty heroine, John Huston's wily John Hay or Steve Kanaly's spiffy, radiant, ruthless can-do lieutenant, Roosevelt's ""Big Stick"".  ",1
) Don't waste your time.  ,0
The entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film.  ,1
Brilliant!  ,1
An excellent performance from Ms.  ,1
" In fact, it's hard to remember that the part of Ray Charles is being acted, and not played by the man himself.  	1
Ray Charles is legendary.  	1
Ray Charles' life provided excellent biographical material for the film, which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician.  	1
Hitchcock is a great director.  	1
Ironically I mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch.  	0
Secondly, Hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie.  	1
It's this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films.  	0
Hence the whole story lacks a certain energy.  	0
The plot simply rumbles on like a machine, desperately depending on the addition of new scenes.  	0
There are the usual Hitchcock logic flaws.  	0
Mishima is extremely uninteresting.  	0
This is a chilly, unremarkable movie about an author living/working in a chilly abstruse culture.  	0
The flat reenactments don't hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy.  	0
And the rest of it just sits there being awful... with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to, hairsplitting about purity, the admiration of swords, etc.  	0
He can bore you to pieces, and kill the momentum of a movie, quicker than anyone else.  	0
Schrader has made a resume full of lousy, amateurish films.  	0
When I first watched this movie, in the 80s, I loved it.  	1
I was totally fascinated by the music, the dancing... everything.  	1
However, I recently watched the whole thing again on DVD, and I was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was - how it contained holes, inconsistencies and - frankly - a whole lot of crap - and how horrid the dancing was.  	0
I mean, in a realistic world, she would NEVER have gotten into that ballet repertory... The whole thing was quite pathetic.  	0
The character developments also lacked in depth.  	0
Woa, talk about awful.  	0
Do not waste your time.  	0
It was just too horrible.  	0
The worst, sappiest dialogue... I could go on and on.  	0
But what really made it unwatchable was the direction.  	0
The poor actors.  	0
You can't even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action.  	0
If you check the director's filmography on this site you will see why this film didn't have a chance.  	0
This would not even be good as a made for TV flick.  	0
If good intentions made a film great, then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made.  	1
The film has great actors, a master director, a significant theme--at least a would-be significant theme, undertone of fifties existential world-weariness, aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination, and characters about which one might deeply care.  	1
Regrettably, the film fails.  	0
The movie lacks visual interest, drama, expression of feeling, and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative.  	0
No actress has been worse used that June Allison in this movie.  	0
Yet, I enjoy watching it.  	1
Unfortunately, this is a bad movie that is just plain bad.  	0
Bad script, bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad!  	0
The dialogue sucked.  	0
The cinematography-if it can be called that-sucked.  	0
The soundtrack sucked.  	0
The acting sucked.  	0
The concert sequences just sucked.  	0
That was nice.  	1
That was funny.  	1
It was so funny.  	1
Overall, this movie was cheap trash.  	0
But this movie is not funny, considering the ridiculousness of it.  	0
I came out of it feeling angry.  	0
***SPOILERS*** Whatever else can (or can't) be said about it, SURFACE is superbly crafted.  	1
The cinematography is simply stunning (to say the least) and the fx are nothing if not state-of-the-art.  	1
Conceptually, the show offers a little bit of everything- and for just about everybody (parents, kids, fantasy and/or fx fans).  	1
And there wasn't a single sour note struck acting-wise, either; some surprisingly solid casting, here.  	1
All things considered, a job very well done.  	1
Thanks good a movie like this was done and released.  	1
One of the best mexican movies ever!, and one of the less understood, even by mexican themselves, no matter how identified the should have felt with it.  	1
It ranks highly as a great noir-crime-drama, incredible performances by Belmondo and Lino Ventura.  	1
The attention given to every character, and complex psychological portrayals, detailing loyalty, treachery, love, and hope, are tremendous.  	1
It is an excellent drama, an excellent thriller, and an excellent film.  	1
Up there with the best of Melville.  	1
Everything about this film is simply incredible.  	1
You truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child.  	1
BLACK WATER is a thriller that manages to completely transcend it's limitations (it's an indie flick) by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience.  	1
The performances are real and gripping, the crocdodile is extremely well done, indeed if the Black Water website is to be believed that's because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous.  	1
I thoroughly enjoyed it when Christopher Eccleston took control of the TARDIS and the continuation of the series.  	1
I'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film.  	0
If it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than I guess he succeeded.  	0
There is a lot of beautiful places.  	1
It was forced, like everything in this movie.  	0
Again, lame.  	0
Here's where the movie really pi**ed me off.  	0
And don't even get me started on the jerky camerawork.  	0
When I saw it in the theater I thought I was going to be sick.  	0
Summary: The witticisms weren't witty.  	0
The plot - well, I said I'd let that one go.  	0
The acting was bad.  	0
Really bad.  	0
Even Billy Bob couldn't rise above the script, which was worse.  	0
Camerawork - again, bad.  	0
Rating: 1 out of 10.  	0
An AMAZING finale to possibly the BEST trilogy of all time!  	1
Kieslowski never ceases to amaze me.  	1
He is one of my favourite directors, and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema.  	1
His use of the colours of the French flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible, every shot, every scene was like a work of art.  	1
Three of the most visually appealing movies i've ever seen.  	1
And his subtle connections between the three films are awesome.  	1
I have to mention this and it is a huge SPOILER, i loved the ending, how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster, with Valentine and the young judge together, and the old man watching it on her TV, solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years.  	1
I couldn't think of a better way to end the film, but a smile on my face, great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy!  	1
I recommend this for EVERYONE who loves film, movies, anything...A Work of Art!  	1
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy.  	1
I literally vomited while watching this film.  	0
I think i was one of the people who found this another one of roth's pearls.  	1
his performance, as awarded, was stunning.  	1
the story which was told so eloquently by Francis ford Coppola 25 years earlier, really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop.  	1
In a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast.  	1
All in all a beautiful directed film from Nicola's roeg wih a sublime cast.  	1
I'm translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5-year working experience that I found offensive to my intelligence.  	0
But when someone strives for greatness and poetry, but delivers a muddled (and often ridiculous) story, a bunch of disparate scenes, pretentious dialogue... Then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap"".  ",0
But this movie is definitely a below average rent.  ,0
Very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the Oscar shortlist.  ,0
And it was boring.  ,0
"The film gives meaning to the phrase, ""Never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few.  ",1
"However Paul Schrader has indeed made a film ""about"" Mishima that is both superb & complex.  ",1
The attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosen't bear thinking about which basically involves a Vulcan stealing the Enterprise to find god (seriously) I just didn't care about any of this film and oh not to mention Uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards.  ,0
I would give this television series a 10 plus if i could.  ,1
"Much more interesting, more action, more suspense, and less of the unneeded controversy.  ",1
"Special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects, which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon.  ",1
"Saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort, good messages for kids.  ",1
"A Lassie movie which should have been ""put to sleep"".... FOREVER.  ",0
"It's an empty, hollow shell of a movie.  ",0
"Characters are one-dimensional, even the good guys and especially the bad guys.  ",0
STEAMBOAT WILLIE is an amazingly important film to our cinema history.  ,1
This one just fails to create any real suspense.  ,0
The story line is just awful!  ,0
The movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night.  ,1
Tom Wilkinson broke my heart at the end... and everyone else's judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike.  ,1
Watching washing machine twirling around wouldn't hurt your eyes as much as this show.  ,0
"The film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand, for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesser-known cast and for the super-intelligent script that doesn't insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism.  ",1
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast - everyone played their parts really well.  ,1
Damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different Characters on screen.  ,1
Vivian Schilling did an excellent job with the script.  ,1
"I do not know if this was Emilio Estevez's directorial debut, but the pacing, the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character Estevez plays all suggest a natural eye.  ",1
It's still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema.  ,1
"The plot, such as it is, is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing.  ",0
"Just whatever you do, avoid ""Groove"" as its the antithesis of all that is good about Human Traffic.  ",0
It Was So Cool.  ,1
"If there was ever a movie that needed word-of-mouth to promote, this is it.  ",1
The movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy.  ,0
"Very true to Shakespear, and a 'must' for all Shakespear fans.  ",1
"I agree with Jessica, this movie is pretty bad.  ",0
I just saw this film and I recommend it.  ,1
Enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film.  ,1
"Both films are terrible, but to the credit of the 1986 version, it was watchable.  ",0
"I was very uneasy with how bad this movie was, but not scared at all.  ",0
This mostly routine fact-based TV drama gets a boost from the fine performance by Cole.  ,1
"This was reflected not only in the cast, but also in the below-par script, which borrowed much from the earlier classic.  ",0
"It's a gloriously fun, fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver.  ",1
That's how I'd describe this painfully dreary time-waster of a film.  ,0
I was deeply impressed with the character he played.  ,1
"The acting was decidely wooden, though no worse than a period Universal B movie.  ",0
Having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt.  ,1
The directing and the cinematography aren't quite as good.  ,0
My rating: just 3 out of 10.  ,0
"Kathy Bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism; a variation on her character in ""At Play In The Fields Of The Lord"".  ",1
"Full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by Edward Chodorov, who also produced, and is surprisingly directed by Jean Negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more.  ",0
"If you act in such a film, you should be glad that you're gonna drift away from earth as far as possible!  ",0
This is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other.  ,1

"Every element of this story was so over the top, excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through.  ",0
"Being a 90's child, I truly enjoyed this show and I can proudly say that I enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical WB cartoons.  ",1
"As a courtroom drama, it's compelling, as an indictment on the American justice system, it's frightening.  ",1
The script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed.  ,0
What is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in Los Angeles?  ,0
The budget was evidently very limited.  ,0
Duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance.  ,1

Don't waste your time watching this rubbish non-researched film.  ,0

The Songs Were The Best And The Muppets Were So Hilarious.  ,1
The script is a big flawed mess.  ,0
This show is made for Americans - it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichÃ©s to be admitted elsewhere.  ,0
Both Rickman and Stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens' book writer who-- maybe?-- has written a subversive tract.  ,1

You share General Loewenhielm's exquisite joy in his partaking of the Cailles en Sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie - but you do wish for just a small sample to savor.  ,1
